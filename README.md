# data-visualization-with-matplotlib
Matplotlib is a powerful library for creating visualizations in Python. Here's an example program that reads data from a CSV file, performs data analysis, and visualizes the results using Matplotlib.

Replace 'data.csv' with the actual path to your CSV file. This program loads the data, performs data analysis or calculations (which you would need to specify), and creates three different types of plots: a bar chart, a scatter plot, and a line chart.

You can customize the plots by adding additional arguments to the plotting functions and exploring the various features provided by Matplotlib.
